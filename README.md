# Sales_Projections
The goal for this project is to use python to analyze features within a dataset and create regression models that can be used to predict sales in the future.
Our Data dictionary is as follows: 

Variable Name |	Description
Item_Identifier -	Unique product ID
Item_Weight -	Weight of product
Item_Fat_Content -	Whether the product is low fat or regular
Item_Visibility -	The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
Item_Type -	The category to which the product belongs
Item_MRP -	Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
Outlet_Identifier -	Unique store ID
Outlet_Establishment_Year -	The year in which store was established
Outlet_Size -	The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
Outlet_Location_Type -	The type of area in which the store is located
Outlet_Type -	Whether the outlet is a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
Item_Outlet_Sales -	Sales of the product in the particular store. This is the target variable to be predicted.

In this analysis we use various figures to explore our data; the first of which is a barchart of total sales at each outlet, followed by exploratory figures examining key differences between the highest selling outlet and the lowest selling including, in order, the sales numbers of items based on fat content, the average visibility of items at each outlet, and the sales counts of items based on their type. 

Lastly, we conclude this analysis with a comparison of regression models to determine which model is best suited for making predictions of data in the future. We begin with a simple linear regression model and compare it to a regression tree. Based on our data, we determine a regression tree is best suited to making predictions about new data in the future.
